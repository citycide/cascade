> Method & assignment cascades for Nim, inspired by Smalltalk & Dart.

cascade is a macro for Nim that implements _method cascades_, a feature
originally from Smalltalk that's made its way into modern languages like
[Dart][dart] and [Kotlin][kotlin].

It allows you to avoid repeating an object's name for each method call
or assignment. A common case is something like a button:

```nim
# before
var res = Button()
res.text = "ok"
res.width = 30
res.color = "#13a89e"
res.btnEcho()
```

With cascade, you don't need to repeat yourself:

```nim
# after
let btn = cascade Button():
  text = "ok"
  width = 30
  color = "#13a89e"
  btnEcho()
```

Cascade also offers a `with` macro to replace the deprecated ``{.with.}``
pragma in Nim. This macro looks up all identifiers in a code block to see if
they are known field names for the given object. If a match is found, the
identifier is replaced by a dot expression ``obj.field``.

Example:


```nim
type Foo = ref object
  first: int
  second: string
  third: float

var foo = Foo(first: 1, second: "two", third: 3.0)

with foo:
  echo first
  if true:
    third = float(first)
  echo second
```


Also notice you can avoid declaring a `var` if you don't need to modify
the target object after the fact, since it remains mutable within the
cascade block.

## installation & usage

Install using [Nimble][nimble]:

```shell
nimble install cascade
```

Then `import` and use:

```nim
import cascade

let x = cascade y:
  z = 10
  f()
```

## building

To build cascade from source you'll need to have [Nim][nim] installed,
and should also have [Nimble][nimble], Nim's package manager.

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/citycide/cascade.git`
2. Move into the newly cloned directory: `cd cascade`
3. Make your changes: `cascade.nim`, `tests/tests.nim`
4. Run tests: `nimble test`
